Record my learning experience.(I'm not good at english. But I want to learn it. So I use english here.)

## Learning How to Use GitHub

I'm learning how to create a repository, create a branch, make a commit, open a pull request and merge pull request.(Edit by the other branch)  
I have learned how to create a folder in repository.(Type a folder name followed by "/" to go down into a subfolder)  
I met a problem how to start a new line here.(Type 2 "Space" key in the end of line)
Change README.md. Then fetch and merge.  

### Learning How to Use Git

You can find the detail [here](https://git-scm.com/book/zh/v2).

touch    
mkdir  
cd  
ls  

git init: To take a directory and turn it into a new Git repository so you can start version controlling it.
git clone: Wrapper around several other commands.(mkdir, git init, git remote add, git fetch, git checkout)
git remote add <shortname> <url>  
git remote -v  
git add  
git commit  
git fetch [remote-name] (git fetch origin)  
git pull  
git push [remote-name] [branch-name] (git push origin master)
